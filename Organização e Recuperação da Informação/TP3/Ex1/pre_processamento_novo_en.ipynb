            "she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold\n",
            "and distant; and though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will\n",

            "Her manners, too--and Mr. Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet.\n",

            "to her and the most soothing to him, had in all likelihood been\n",

            "in front of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution\n",
            "of maintaining it.  He did not omit being sometimes directly\n",
            "before Miss Smith, or speaking to those who were close to her.--\n",

            "One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in,\"\n",

            "Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed,\n",
            "without reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied\n",
            "there was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in\n",
            "her style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.--\n",
            "It might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an\n",

            "\n",
            "She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation;\n",
            "and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it,\n",
            "without resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss.\n",
            "Harriet really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist.\n",
            "Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill\n",
            "health was a recommendation to her--and though not so fond of a\n",
            "dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet\n",
            "under her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister's side,\n",
            "Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her very persuadable.--\n",
            "Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was\n",
            "to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.--It was all arranged,\n",
